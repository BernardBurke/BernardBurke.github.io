# This is getting messy..

I don't recall a time where my sense of division in society was so strong. The more I talk to others, the more I'm finding that other's are sensing the same thing. 

No great surprise, that others notice the same thing. This is partially related to the circle of people around me, my existing biases and the new biases I develop from feeding by brain.

**What can slow or reverse the divisions in going on in our world?**

This is a giant topic and this the first post. Fortunately, there are great ideas arising on the interwebs everyday. 

People have been kind enough to refer to me as a decent compass for valuable content. If there's any truth in that, then the major reason is... I get great recommendations from friends (Trish Nowland this time.)
