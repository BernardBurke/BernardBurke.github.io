## A time where death leads to our minds being replicated into the cloud.

I was talking to an old friend and mentor this morning. We quickly moved on from Hello to 'what's going on'.

"I'm doing well thanks," I said. I found myself reflecting on my virtual people interactions in the last week or so. I've been blessed with many wonderful interactions, especially lately.

I spoke about the idea that human's minds might be immortalised in computer systems, many stories coming to mind. 

Living in lockdown, we **are** experiencing parts of this idea. I probably have a bigger dose than most; I'm online for much of the day. 

My face-to-face interactions have become very special - I'm fortunate to have a bubble partner...she and I have been able to hang out every couple of weeks. They are occasions to look forward to and reflect on.

... and maybe stop me from enjoying lockdown **too** much. 

The phone call with my friend and mentor was patchy - poor reception, probably at his end, which is rural. The hard edge on voices and the 'coldness' of digital music fit the Story.

I think my favourite transmigrate to the could story is the Black Mirror episode called San Junipero.

Have you seen San Junipero? There's a pretty decent review/rundown [here](https://medium.com/@spyrtzan/digitalizing-the-consciousness-black-mirrors-san-junipero-6fe6bc1db57f)
