## No Comments!

This site is an attempt to un-platform while giving me (and anybody that wants some help) a means to create
a simple and secure platform to share some thoughts and experiences. 

I don't intend to do any promotion of this site. It's my public diary and scrapbook. 

So, I'm doing my best to stay away from **any** technology that tracks interactions - like you, reading this line now. 

The technology (github pages and jekyll) offers a framework that supports my goals. There are many [themes](https://jekyllthemes.io/free) that support Comments on the blog framework. It sounded like a *nice to have, but not essential* feature to me. 

As I've learned more about the platform, I've realised a deeper set of complexity that comes with what might be considered *simple blog comments*. 

#### The world is illusory. Brahman alone is real. Brahman is the World. 
#### Disqus.

Yeah, I'd love to discuss this. But I quickly came to realise that [Disqus](www.disqus.com) is *not* a suitable technology/platform for what I'm trying to achieve here. (It's commonly integrated into Jekyll themes and would be 'easy' to deploy)

I was always a bit suspect of Disqus links in sites and pages. *What, you want me to sign up just to say "Hell Yeah"?*. That was a decent instinct. 

I'll cut to the chase. Pretty much any means that I've looked at that allows me to:
- run a static website
- allows anyone/everyone/someone to comment (write)

... will kind of break the mould. Sounds hard to believe. I'm pretty amazed that I never really thought about this before - just show's how long it's been since I've been actively involved in publishing anything custom online.

For now, I'm going to manually curate any comments via [email]("mailto:bernard.francis.burke@gmail.com") until I figure this one out.

## Not convinced. Yet.

The following appears to be containing a fair bit if truth.
- If you sign up with someone/anyone's online 'service', they will be capturing parts of your digital identity, *even if they have nothing but good intentions!*
- I could deploy my own comments system on a webserver somewhere. I could let *anyone* reply. As soon as I do that, I'll have to manage spam and bots. This breaks the simplicity mould, meaning anything I achieve here might be of little use to others (especially people that don't want to get into the tech details)
- Curating the content might be a perfectly reasonable answer for a low volume of responses. Maybe one day I'll upset somebody by ignoring/blocking their comments. That is a tiny issue for now... and
- There's gotta be a way to do *this*.

### And what is 'this'?

Use a digital identity system that give's visitors/commenters the ability to protect their Digital Identity *and* any data/content they create.

In an ideal world, it might look like this:

- You read some content and want to reply 'inline'.
- The experience has gotta be easy - say, no harder than replying to a tweet. (people's preference for Ease is never more obvious than when they are Online (IMO))
- We can leave a moderated 'gate' open for anonymous commenters.
- [Commentors](https://grammarist.com/usage/commentator-commenter/) might be prepared to use one of their digital Identities to sign and own their comments
- There should be trust assigned by [Web of Trust Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust) that is easy to use. Ahem, you say. I know - this could be tricky to implement. 
- I have a personal 'belief' that people would like an anonymised digital Identity that *can* be part of a Web of Trust. I might be dreaming. I might be off with *The Fairies*. For now, I'm gonna dig into this idea.
