## Spring - October 2006

During this time, I would have been descending into my Deepest Green meme. Arguably, I was in a lot of trouble by this time. 

I no longer wanted to be part of the WEIRD world.

It's an interesting exercise to look at my perspectives from 16 years ago. Some of my allusions are a little cringe-worthy...

At the time, I was kicked into action by the USA's population crossing the 300 million boundary. Couple that with the history of October Surprise conceptually.

I've still got some time for the poems title...

#Democracy Fries

```
Silently the News said - Nill
The BusinessAsUsual rang the till
A Horse race smoke room drank it's fill
The 300 millionth Yankee born despite Pill...

Persian Sabres, now silent for a while
Bush's mug missing from the mind-slave dial
The Dow at new records, evil stockbroker smile
Hurricane Self Delusion off the coast by a mile

Here, Aussie spring, Bees are swarming,
Not upset by the global warming.
Many tonnes of coal. pig. sniff. truffles.
Government money for copulant couples. 

Across western world the Safety Illusion
Is artfully wrought by the Media Collusion.
While our Digital Debt Press floods at full speed
We'll think that we have all the money we need.

And go back to sleep. That's the plan as I see it.
A Circus of media. Bread Miracle Money Pit.

How did we get so far of course? 
Is it in our nature to drown in The Sauce?
Like yeast in the beer we make poison gas
And pump all the handles till Critical Mass.

Ask a bee
How to be.
Ask the Sea
How to see.

White Man fell from trees. Built boats, sailed seas
Bought Hunger, Disease.

Did he ever say please? Or was promise Deep Freeze?
A swamp of Pizza top cheese...child slaves upon knees...

Anybody with half a brain
Can see the wreck of this growth train.
That globalisation exports pain
And Human Wax is now On the Wane

And the rich white man the darkest stain. Feeling proud are we?

This dark passage reads as a weather report.
"Fine, wheter or not there's Policemen of Thought"
"Occasional showers of Fascism bought"
"By allowing Big Business to Government rort"
"Hurricane Delusion? Teacup storm!" they retort.

I'm not so sure if I believe Whether Man
Has got all his problems sealed up in iCan.
As I write, I can see my barometer dropping
Our 60 odd years of peace might be topping.

And DONT tell me "Not to worry. Go Shopping!"

In the Atlantic, Delusion storm inland blown
In the Tasman/Pacific, our Delusion Cyclone.
The outcome of this mess will shortly be known.

That salty storm mist so grey in slate tone
A far off Story wind is throating its moan...

My foundations groan. Time to payback the loan.

"Here you are Sir, Your October Surpise..."
"Would you like to Upsize to Democracy Fries?"

Ask a bee
How to be.
Ask the Sea
How to see.
