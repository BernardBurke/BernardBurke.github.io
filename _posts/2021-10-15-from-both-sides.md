# Land Slides Now

Rows and roads of buildings bare  
Distressed selling in the air  
And value canyons everywhere  
I've bought a house that way  

But now the price above the Sun  
They reign as Gold and Doomers shun  
So many people's chances done  
No House will come their way.  

I've bought a house from both sides now  
Number Go Up, like Sacred Cow  
It's House Illusions I'd see fall  
We really don't own land at all.  

To the Moon, tax refund deals  
No dizzy thinking, buy with Feels  
Real Estate is far from Real  
When most just cannot Pay.  

Economies are Meant to Grow  
Don't bring Malthus to this show  
You try a Death Pledge, all-in Go  
And give Yourself away  

I've seen a House from both sides now  
From roof and kids to Lipstick Sow  
The House Illusion makes us small    
We cannot let the prices Fall  
We really don't own Things at all  

Tears and fears or misplaced pride  
Or game the system, pick a side  
But all I see is Bill Hicks Ride  
Till our Sun burns away  

But now old friends lack words to change  
They're finding Zoomer's haircuts strange  
Well something's lost and little gained  
Don't look the other way  

I've sold my soul from both sides now    
From Righteousness to Growth Kowtow  
My Life Illusion mis-recalled  
There really are no Rights at all
