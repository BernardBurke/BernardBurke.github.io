# Game A is over.

The internet led me to the Jim Rutt show a couple of years back. On my first take, I wasn't sure what to make of Jim or the show. 

As is often the case, if you arrive at a podcast, go and have a look at the [site](https://www.jimruttshow.com/). I was suprised by the professionalism of the site. I looked at the archive and said *Wow*. The transcripts and said *how?*.

Jim was a successful computer dude, back in the day. Ran a little outfit called [Network Solutions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2000/03/08/with-deal-niche-pays-off-again-for-network-solutions/05b0d781-acdb-4fe9-a5bd-8db8eed7f688/). 


His bio on [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu/people/profile/jim-rutt) refers to the path he took from cashing out of Dot Bomb through to scientific research around a central topic that we often label Sustainability.

So, he remains as gruff as the NYT's label of "the Internet's Bad Boy" and I **know** some folks will find it hard to get past this. This was a small-ish effort for me, as I can give him a pass for being a Country Boy with parallels to many I knew in the Genus of what we might call Tech.

## Game B

Jim became one of several proponents of Game B upon my collision with the term. The name is based a proposal to design a replacement for Game A - the way Life is for Humans now. 

Here's a quote from the [Game B Wiki](https://www.gameb.wiki/index.php?title=Game_B)

> "Game B is notoriously difficult to think and talk about for the very good reason that if you were using the > conceptual structures that came out of Game A to do so, you may very well be poisoning the well." 
> -- Jordan Hall.

## Two outstanding interviews

This week, I caught up with Jim and [Zak Stein](http://www.zakstein.org/), who I've known of since I did my Lectica Decision Making Assessment(https://dts.lectica.org/_about/showcase.php?instrument_id=LDMA) some years ago.

The topic is [**Information War and Propaganda**](https://www.jimruttshow.com/zak-stein-5/)

Early on, Jim points out that we are all subject to biases... worse still, the more educated and *well read* we are, the more susceptible we are to confirmation bias.

> And thereâ€™s a problem with doing propaganda research, actually at a high level. And I fell into the rabbit 
> hole myself. And I mentioned this in the first paper, which is that once you start to see information this
> way, and you start to realize the decades of history of sophisticated, psychologically manipulative
> information warfare, you start to be potentially suspicious of everything. -**Zak**


Back Soon!
