## Travis and Lex on Python and libraries

If you are into programming and Python, this podcast is for you. 

I continue to be amazed by [Lex Fridman](https://lexfridman.com/) . In my view, he's an authoritative voice on AI - that, by itself, makes him a hero of mine. Teaching at [Deeplearning at MIT](https://deeplearning.mit.edu/) is a pretty good qualification.

There is a *lot* more to Lex than robotics and machine learning. (eg. [Eric Weinstein, Difficult Conversations, Freedom and Physics](https://lexfridman.com/eric-weinstein-4) )

This particular [podcast](https://lexfridman.com/travis-oliphant/) is Lex at his best. Talking techie with [Travis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Oliphant), who's something of a legend as I've come to learn.

If you haven't listened to a lot of long-form podcast, this is a great example. Today, I finished my walk along with another brilliant long-form podcast, ready to take on some training for a couple of hours. 

Travis is a character, in my view. He presents as both smart, honest and humble, which is a great combo.

The training was soon forgotten about. Time passed in that weird way that it does (for me) when I'm fascinated.

Enjoy it folks.
