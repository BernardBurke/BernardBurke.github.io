## No, I don't know anybody who knows anybody that predicted this.

This news hit pretty hard in my view. The reactions I've heard from friends and journalists include:
- A good distraction from other problems popped out to distract from election issues.
- A clear message that Australia remains a US ally when considering rising tensions with China.
- If we (oz) had any brains and really wanted nuclear submarines, we'd buy them from Japan instead of starting another endless sub construction debacle. 

The timeline for constructing and deploying such a sub is **the 2040s!**

An interesting perspective from [Roger Bradbury ANU Professor of Complex Systems Science ](https://www.abc.net.au/radio/adelaide/programs/worldtoday/australia-us-submarine-deal-angers-france,-china/13546548) suggests the submarines will be basically redundant by the time we've built them (~2:30 in the audio stream)


Whatever the bigger picture is, my reactions mostly point at the breakdown of the Peace I've had the good 
fortune to live in over the last ~60 years.
