## Hymn 2

```
Once we were lost
Feeling the frost
Where do we go?
How shall we know?

Feelings and Mind
Sight of the blind
When was the start?
I'm just a part

This Gravity, waves sand from sea
On edge of tide I will abide
And trust my life
To sense all strife
And write this tome
That leads us home


Life simply is
No answer quiz
Eye of the teem
Follow the Beam


Breathing the light
Into the night
Nothing to hold
Just Let Unfold


Come join the dance
Aware of trance
Sense into core
When next before
As end begins, there are no sins
Leaves of the Tree
Each you is me

```
