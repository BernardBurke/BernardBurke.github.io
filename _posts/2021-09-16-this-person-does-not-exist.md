## Can you tell already?
*Look closely. Something is not right. This picture was created by a GAN, a generative adversarial network.*

Trying to talk to a lot of people is hard. We reduce things down to sound bites and 5 minute news reports. Expectations point as News packaged, similar to a can of baked beans.

It might be a but more complicated than that. If you wanna rev me up on a conversation, let's talk about AI.

Has me thinking about human development. A baby looking at themselves in a mirror. Recognising the self. 

"And the image glues itself onto the baby"

We are grown up versions of that baby. With a reflection of how we saw ourselves in that mirror.
