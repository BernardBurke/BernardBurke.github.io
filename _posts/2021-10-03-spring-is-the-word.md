# Words and Expressions that Leap into consciousness

## Compersion

This was a new term to me a few months ago. As it's not in widespread use, it's a little hard to apply a contextual meaning.

Here is one that I've been happy to adopt

>  The word compersion is loosely defined as the opposite of jealousy. Instead of feeling upset or threatened >  when your partner romantically or sexually interacts with another person, you feel a sense of happiness for > them.

For me, it's a term and an emotional framework I'd like to bring into my Competition vs. Cooperation vernacular.

I think it has an application in my Winners and Losers thinking.


## Strange Loops

Reading [Douglas Hofstadter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_a_Strange_Loop) led to my intoxication with this term. 

## Internecine

An adjective for our times, describing the kind of conflict that is destructive to both/all *sides* of a conflict.

*"The Internecine Internet"*

## Knowledge is no guarantee of good behaviour. But ignorance is a virtual guarantee of bad behaviour.

Speaks for itself in my view.
