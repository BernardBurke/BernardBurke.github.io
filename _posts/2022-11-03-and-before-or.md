```
Tick tick tick 
We while away
Dredging the mind for 
Kind things to say

What will they be
That cheer us all on?
How would we welcome
What's here Will be Gone?

Roots of the tree
Bio Mimicry. 
The Axiom land
Is foundational sand.

Before canyon's were Grand
The Truth of the Land
Was unity plural.
Our language tried mural.
And we named our Right Hand
And chose Or over And

When the Sandman comes and the mind monkeys rest
They held out a message in ways to attest.

It says - this.
On the road to Neti Neti lore
The first steps start with preference for Or.

It can be mined and mind
We can be fine for thine
We can be water wine
There is a formless spine

So, says Sandthou - 
"Next when your mind..
Sees a judgement where experience Blind
Place a foot on a Woken Core
Kindly choose the preference Or"

Inclusion means
There is no Them
Only Us.
