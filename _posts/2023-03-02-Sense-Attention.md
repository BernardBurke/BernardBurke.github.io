```
The Hatching.
Of Bigness of Bang.

Nothing becomes somethings.

Emptiness expands
Planets beget lands
Evolutions demands
Washed up on the sands

With every intention 
I'm sensing a tension.
Pulling right pushing down
Tree of Good-Evil town

Life comes into being by these tensions foreseeing 
Samsara wide forces pulling nought into something.
