<p>I don‚Äôt recall a time where my sense of division in society was so strong. The more I talk to others, the more I‚Äôm finding that other‚Äôs are sensing the same thing.</p>

<p>No great surprise, that others notice the same thing. This is partially related to the circle of people around me, my existing biases and the new biases I develop from feeding by brain.</p>
