<p>This news hit pretty hard in my view. The reactions Iâ€™ve heard from friends and journalists include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A good distraction from other problems popped out to distract from election issues.</li>
  <li>A clear message that Australia remains a US ally when considering rising tensions with China.</li>
  <li>If we (oz) had any brains and really wanted nuclear submarines, weâ€™d buy them from Japan instead of starting another endless sub construction debacle.</li>
</ul>

<p>The timeline for constructing and deploying such a sub is <strong>the 2040s!</strong></p>

<p>An interesting perspective from <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/radio/adelaide/programs/worldtoday/australia-us-submarine-deal-angers-france,-china/13546548">Roger Bradbury ANU Professor of Complex Systems Science </a> suggests the submarines will be basically redundant by the time weâ€™ve built them (~2:30 in the audio stream)</p>

<p>Whatever the bigger picture is, my reactions mostly point at the breakdown of the Peace Iâ€™ve had the good 
fortune to live in over the last ~60 years.</p>
