<p>If you are into programming and Python, this podcast is for you.</p>

<p>I continue to be amazed by <a href="https://lexfridman.com/">Lex Fridman</a> . In my view, he’s an authoritative voice on AI - that, by itself, makes him a hero of mine. Teaching at <a href="https://deeplearning.mit.edu/">Deeplearning at MIT</a> is a pretty good qualification.</p>

<p>There is a <em>lot</em> more to Lex than robotics and machine learning. (eg. <a href="https://lexfridman.com/eric-weinstein-4">Eric Weinstein, Difficult Conversations, Freedom and Physics</a> )</p>

<p>This particular <a href="https://lexfridman.com/travis-oliphant/">podcast</a> is Lex at his best. Talking techie with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Oliphant">Travis</a>, who’s something of a legend as I’ve come to learn.</p>

<p>If you haven’t listened to a lot of long-form podcast, this is a great example. Today, I finished my walk along with another brilliant long-form podcast, ready to take on some training for a couple of hours.</p>

<p>Travis is a character, in my view. He presents as both smart, honest and humble, which is a great combo.</p>

<p>The training was soon forgotten about. Time passed in that weird way that it does (for me) when I’m fascinated.</p>

<p>Enjoy it folks.</p>
