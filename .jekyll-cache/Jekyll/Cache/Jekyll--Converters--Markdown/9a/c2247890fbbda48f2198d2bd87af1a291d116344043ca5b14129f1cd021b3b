I"µ<h2 id="no-comments">No Comments!</h2>

<p>This site is an attempt to un-platform while giving me (and anybody that wants some help) a means to create
a simple and secure platform to share some thoughts and experiences.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t intend to do any promotion of this site. Itâ€™s my public diary and scrapbook.</p>

<p>So, Iâ€™m doing my best to stay away from <strong>any</strong> technology that tracks interactions - like you, reading this line now.</p>

<p>The technology (github pages and jekyll) offers a framework that supports my goals. There are many <a href="https://jekyllthemes.io/free">themes</a> that support Comments on the blog framework. It sounded like a <em>nice to have, but not essential</em> feature to me.</p>

<p>As Iâ€™ve learned more about the platform, Iâ€™ve realised a deeper set of complexity that comes with what might be considered <em>simple blog comments</em>.</p>

<h4 id="the-world-is-illusory-brahman-alone-is-real-brahman-is-the-world">The world is illusory. Brahman alone is real. Brahman is the World.</h4>
<h4 id="disqus">Disqus.</h4>

<p>Yeah, Iâ€™d love to discuss this. But I quickly came to realise that <a href="www.disqus.com">Disqus</a> is <em>not</em> a suitable technology/platform for what Iâ€™m trying to achieve here. (Itâ€™s commonly integrated into Jekyll themes and would be â€˜easyâ€™ to deploy)</p>

<p>I was always a bit suspect of Disqus links in sites and pages. <em>What, you want me to sign up just to say â€œHell Yeahâ€?</em>. That was a decent instinct.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll cut to the chase. Pretty much any means that Iâ€™ve looked at that allows me to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>run a static website</li>
  <li>allows anyone/everyone/someone to comment (write)</li>
</ul>

<p>â€¦ will kind of break the mould. Sounds hard to believe. Iâ€™m pretty amazed that I never really thought about this before - just showâ€™s how long itâ€™s been since Iâ€™ve been actively involved in publishing anything custom online.</p>

<p>For now, Iâ€™m going to manually curate any comments via <a href="&quot;mailto:bernard.francis.burke@gmail.com&quot;">email</a> until I figure this one out.</p>

<h2 id="not-convinced-yet">Not convinced. Yet.</h2>

<p>The following appears to be containing a fair bit if truth.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you sign up with someone/anyoneâ€™s online â€˜serviceâ€™, they will be capturing parts of your digital identity, <em>even if they have nothing but good intentions!</em></li>
  <li>I could deploy my own comments system on a webserver somewhere. I could let <em>anyone</em> reply. As soon as I do that, Iâ€™ll have to manage spam and bots. This breaks the simplicity mould, meaning anything I achieve here might be of little use to others (especially people that donâ€™t want to get into the tech details)</li>
  <li>Curating the content might be a perfectly reasonable answer for a low volume of responses. Maybe one day Iâ€™ll upset somebody by ignoring/blocking their comments. That is a tiny issue for nowâ€¦ and</li>
  <li>Thereâ€™s gotta be a way to do <em>this</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="and-what-is-this">And what is â€˜thisâ€™?</h3>

<p>Use a digital identity system that giveâ€™s visitors/commenters the ability to protect their Digital Identity <em>and</em> any data/content they create.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, it might look like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You read some content and want to reply â€˜inlineâ€™.</li>
  <li>The experience has gotta be easy - say, no harder than replying to a tweet. (peopleâ€™s preference for Ease is never more obvious than when they are Online (IMO))</li>
  <li>We can leave a moderated â€˜gateâ€™ open for anonymous commenters.</li>
  <li><a href="https://grammarist.com/usage/commentator-commenter/">Commentors</a> might be prepared to use one of their digital Identities to sign and own their comments</li>
  <li>There should be trust assigned by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust">Web of Trust Model</a> that is easy to use. Ahem, you say. I know - this could be tricky to implement.</li>
  <li>I have a personal â€˜beliefâ€™ that people would like an anonymised digital Identity that <em>can</em> be part of a Web of Trust. I might be dreaming. I might be off with <em>The Fairies</em>. For now, Iâ€™m gonna dig into this idea.</li>
</ul>
