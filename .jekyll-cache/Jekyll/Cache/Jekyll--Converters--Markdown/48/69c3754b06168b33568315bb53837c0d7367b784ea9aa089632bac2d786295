<p>I was talking to an old friend and mentor this morning. We quickly moved on from Hello to ‘what’s going on’.</p>

<p>“I’m doing well thanks,” I said. I found myself reflecting on my virtual people interactions in the last week or so. I’ve been blessed with many wonderful interactions, especially lately.</p>

<p>I spoke about the idea that human’s minds might be immortalised in computer systems, many stories coming to mind.</p>

<p>Living in lockdown, we <strong>are</strong> experiencing parts of this idea. I probably have a bigger dose than most; I’m online for much of the day.</p>

<p>My face-to-face interactions have become very special - I’m fortunate to have a bubble partner…she and I have been able to hang out every couple of weeks. They are occasions to look forward to and reflect on.</p>

<p>… and maybe stop me from enjoying lockdown <strong>too</strong> much.</p>

<p>The phone call with my friend and mentor was patchy - poor reception, probably at his end, which is rural. The hard edge on voices and the ‘coldness’ of digital music fit the Story.</p>

<p>I think my favourite transmigrate to the could story is the Black Mirror episode called San Junipero.</p>

<p>Have you seen San Junipero? There’s a pretty decent review/rundown <a href="https://medium.com/@spyrtzan/digitalizing-the-consciousness-black-mirrors-san-junipero-6fe6bc1db57f">here</a></p>
