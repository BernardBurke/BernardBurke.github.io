<p>The internet can be horrific and wonderful in the same hour. For me, there is so much juicy content that I’ll put up with a few downsides.</p>

<p>I’m going to try and do this every week, so I don’t forget the Wonder I experienced when panning for gold in the river of internet.</p>

<h1 id="a-standout-essay">A standout Essay</h1>

<p>For me this week, <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/is-there-a-symmetry-between-metacognition-and-mindreading"> A theory of my own mind </a> was a standout.</p>

<p>This article explores a symmetry between how we so others and <em>how we see ourselves.</em></p>

<p>An indicative quote from the article “These results suggest that a simple route for improving self-awareness is to take a third-person perspective on ourselves. In a similar way, literary novels (and soap operas) encourage us to think about the minds of others, and in turn might shed light on our own lives.”</p>

<p>Reading this article let to me taking a dive into material that has influential in my own beliefs/theory of mind <a href="https://www.benburke.org/i-dragged-myself-out-of-bed/">I dragged myself out of bed </a></p>

<p>Firstly, let me point at a few existing articles from this week.</p>

<h1 id="top-of-the-podverse">Top of the Podverse</h1>

<p>I just looked at my podcast history. It’s less extreme than it used to be. I’ve been described as a Podmonster by my community poddies at fishburners.org - my earphones are Always On while walking or doing autonomic tasks.</p>

<h2 id="there-are-existing-articles-for-the-two-standouts">There are existing articles for the two standouts:</h2>

<p><a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/travis-oliphant-numpy-scipy-lex-fridman/">Travis Oliphant (Numpy Scipy) on the Lex Fridman podcast</a> and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/michael-shermer-ashley-rindsberg-the-grey-lady-winked/">The Gray Lady Winked</a></p>

<h2 id="for-meditators-and-those-interested-internal-inquiry">For meditators and those interested internal inquiry,</h2>

<p>I’d recommend <a href="https://www.dailyevolver.com/2021/09/when-meditation-goes-wrong/">When Meditation Goes Wrong</a> on The Daily Evolver. Jeff discusses some of the dark sides of traditional practices in a modern context. Dan Lawton, the guest, wrote <a href="https://danlawton.substack.com/p/when-buddhism-goes-bad">this</a> essay that led to the interview.</p>

<h2 id="a-panel-of-psychologists-and-sociologists-at-the">A panel of psychologists and sociologists at the</h2>

<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/royal-institution/conspiracy-theories-ri-science-podcast-50?utm_source=www.rigb.org"> Royal Institute </a>  This is as mainstream as anything you’ll find. While not being explicitly unkind to fringe thinkers, I note that there was little reference to the Wild West nature of internet ‘news’ nor the loss of trust in Institutions including media, governments and commercialised Universities.</p>

<p>Still, this content should suit those attracted to Hard Categories and narratives that encourage Exceptionalism.</p>

<p>My reactions to this podcast is leading me into the content and references in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(social_science)"> Social Sciences concepts of Identity</a></p>

<h2 id="as-we-mourn-the-passing-of">As we mourn the passing of</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_K._Williams"> Michael K Williams </a>, the folks at <a href="https://play.acast.com/s/thewire-stripped/michael-k-williams-omar-little-special-rest-in-power"> The Wire Stripped </a> created a wonderful reflection on life, the art and the work of the actor who gave us <a href="https://youtu.be/w2F3eLZHmoA"> Omar </a></p>

<h2 id="the-giving-experiment">The Giving Experiment</h2>

<p>.. is one of those stories you might never hear about without a fringe-ish podcast. In this case, it’s Chris Rynan’s most recent <a href="https://chrisryanphd.com/494-christina-and-owen-dargatz-the-giving-experiment/"> Tangentially Speaking Episode 494 </a>, where you’ll hear from Christina And Owen becoming mortified as their 5 children grew emotionally disconnected from the suffering and struggle in the world.</p>

<p>The courage expressed by these people will lift you. Check out <a href="https://www.thegivingexperiment.com/">The Giving Experiment </a> if you don’t have time for the pod. (I would make time for this and recommend same.)</p>

<h1 id="miscellanea">Miscellanea</h1>

<h2 id="weird-and-wonderful-nature">Weird and Wonderful nature</h2>

<p>This week, whilst reading about Bioluminescence, a Rabbit-Hole led me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_shunt"> Viral Shunt </a> and the role it plays on role it plays the Carbon, Nitrogen and Iron cycles.</p>

<p>Another fine thought about interdependent life that arises. Ocean bourne virus, if lined up end to end, would measure <em>200 light years</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G433fa01oMU"> Vincent Racaniello reference </a>.</p>

<p>No viral shunt, no food web. The etymology of <em>virus</em> borrows from the Greek <strong>ios</strong> (poison), and first referred to in Bailey’s dictionary in the 1770s</p>

<p>This feels like a good point to end today’s write up - with a thought for today.</p>

<p>A virus is not really alive. Without virus (plural), no food chain, no oxygen.</p>

<p>Very funny application of a Poison word label.</p>
