<p>I’m fortunate to have plenty of stuff going on lately. Most if that is in the Work domain of life.</p>

<p>It’s been seriously knocking back my podcast listening and online interactions.</p>

<p>I struck a bunch of wonderful free stuff this week that I feel compelled to write about.</p>

<p>Just now, I finished <a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2021/10/18/169-c-thi-nguyen-on-games-art-values-and-agency/">Sean Carrol’s interview with  Thi Nguyen on Games, Art, Values, and Agency</a></p>

<p>Apparently, there <em>are</em> transcripts on Mindscape now. I’ll find them and come back to them.</p>

<p>Suffice to say, I’m think this pod might bring about some change in my Game Theory beliefs, particularly after the <a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2021/10/18/169-c-thi-nguyen-on-games-art-values-and-agency/">Winners are Losers</a> post, in which the writing served a purpose that seems a bit <em>novel</em>.</p>

<p>What I’m trying to express is… by writing all the way to my <em>edge</em> (I’m quoting Steven Grey, Adyashanti), I can sense that some of the stuck emotional struts in belief system seem a lot more mobile.</p>

<p>The analogy coming to mind is.. [sorry, have to come back to this]</p>
