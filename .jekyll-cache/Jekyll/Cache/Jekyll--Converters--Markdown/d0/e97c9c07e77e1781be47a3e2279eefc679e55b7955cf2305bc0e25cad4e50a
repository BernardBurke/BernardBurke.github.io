I"ú<h1 id="game-a-is-over">Game A is over.</h1>

<p>The internet led me to the Jim Rutt show a couple of years back. On my first take, I wasn‚Äôt sure what to make of Jim or the show.</p>

<p>As is often the case, if you arrive at a podcast, go and have a look at the <a href="https://www.jimruttshow.com/">site</a>. I was suprised by the professionalism of the site. I looked at the archive and said <em>Wow</em>. The transcripts and said <em>how?</em>.</p>

<p>Jim was a successful computer dude, back in the day. Ran a little outfit called <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2000/03/08/with-deal-niche-pays-off-again-for-network-solutions/05b0d781-acdb-4fe9-a5bd-8db8eed7f688/">Network Solutions</a>.</p>

<p>His bio on <a href="https://www.santafe.edu/people/profile/jim-rutt">Santa Fe Institute</a> refers to the path he took from cashing out of Dot Bomb through to scientific research around a central topic that we often label Sustainability.</p>

<p>So, he remains as gruff as the NYT‚Äôs label of ‚Äúthe Internet‚Äôs Bad Boy‚Äù and I <strong>know</strong> some folks will find it hard to get past this. This was a small-ish effort for me, as I can give him a pass for being a Country Boy with parallels to many I knew in the Genus of what we might call Tech.</p>

<h2 id="game-b">Game B</h2>

<p>Jim became one of several proponents of Game B upon my collision with the term. The name is based a proposal to design a replacement for Game A - the way Life is for Humans now.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs a quote from the <a href="https://www.gameb.wiki/index.php?title=Game_B">Game B Wiki</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúGame B is notoriously difficult to think and talk about for the very good reason that if you were using the &gt; conceptual structures that came out of Game A to do so, you may very well be poisoning the well.‚Äù 
‚Äì Jordan Hall.</p>

<h2 id="two-outstanding-interviews">Two outstanding interviews</h2>

<p>This week, I caught up with Jim and <a href="http://www.zakstein.org/">Zak Stein</a>, who I‚Äôve known of since I did my Lectica Decision Making Assessment(https://dts.lectica.org/_about/showcase.php?instrument_id=LDMA) some years ago.</p>

<p>The topic is <a href="https://www.jimruttshow.com/zak-stein-5/"><strong>Information War and Propaganda</strong></a></p>

<p>Early on, Jim points out that we are all subject to biases‚Ä¶ worse still, the more educated and <em>well read</em> we are, the more susceptible we are to confirmation bias.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And there‚Äôs a problem with doing propaganda research, actually at a high level. And I fell into the rabbit 
hole myself. And I mentioned this in the first paper, which is that once you start to see information this
way, and you start to realize the decades of history of sophisticated, psychologically manipulative
information warfare, you start to be potentially suspicious of everything. -<strong>Zak</strong></p>

<p>Back Soon!</p>
