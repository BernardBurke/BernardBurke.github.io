<h2 id="compersion">Compersion</h2>

<p>This was a new term to me a few months ago. As it‚Äôs not in widespread use, it‚Äôs a little hard to apply a contextual meaning.</p>

<p>Here is one that I‚Äôve been happy to adopt</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The word compersion is loosely defined as the opposite of jealousy. Instead of feeling upset or threatened &gt;  when your partner romantically or sexually interacts with another person, you feel a sense of happiness for &gt; them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For me, it‚Äôs a term and an emotional framework I‚Äôd like to bring into my Competition vs. Cooperation vernacular.</p>

<p>I think it has an application in my Winners and Losers thinking.</p>

<h2 id="strange-loops">Strange Loops</h2>

<p>Reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_a_Strange_Loop">Douglas Hofstadter</a> led to my intoxication with this term.</p>

<h2 id="internecine">Internecine</h2>

<p>An adjective for our times, describing the kind of conflict that is destructive to both/all <em>sides</em> of a conflict.</p>

<p><em>‚ÄúThe Internecine Internet‚Äù</em></p>

<h2 id="knowledge-is-no-guarantee-of-good-behaviour-but-ignorance-is-a-virtual-guarantee-of-bad-behaviour">Knowledge is no guarantee of good behaviour. But ignorance is a virtual guarantee of bad behaviour.</h2>

<p>Speaks for itself in my view.</p>
