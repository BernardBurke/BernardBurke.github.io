I"ô<h1 id="land-slides-now">Land Slides Now</h1>

<p>Rows and roads of buildings bare<br />
Distressed selling in the air<br />
And value canyons everywhere<br />
Iâ€™ve bought a house that way</p>

<p>But now the price above the Sun<br />
They reign as Gold and Doomers shun<br />
So many peopleâ€™s chances done<br />
No House will come their way.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve bought a house from both sides now<br />
Number Go Up, like Sacred Cow<br />
Itâ€™s House Illusions Iâ€™d see fall<br />
We really donâ€™t own land at all.</p>

<p>To the Moon, tax refund deals<br />
No dizzy thinking, buy with Feels<br />
Real Estate is far from Real<br />
When most just cannot Pay.</p>

<p>Economies are Meant to Grow<br />
Donâ€™t bring Malthus to this show<br />
You try a Death Pledge, all-in Go<br />
And give Yourself away</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve seen a House from both sides now<br />
From roof and kids to Lipstick Sow<br />
The House Illusion makes us small  <br />
We cannot let the prices Fall<br />
We really donâ€™t own Things at all</p>

<p>Tears and fears or misplaced pride<br />
Or game the system, pick a side<br />
But all I see is Bill Hicks Ride<br />
Till our Sun burns away</p>

<p>But now old friends lack words to change<br />
Theyâ€™re finding Zoomerâ€™s haircuts strange<br />
Well somethingâ€™s lost and little gained<br />
Donâ€™t look the other way</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve sold my soul from both sides now  <br />
From Righteousness to Growth Kowtow<br />
My Life Illusion mis-recalled<br />
There really are no Rights at all</p>
